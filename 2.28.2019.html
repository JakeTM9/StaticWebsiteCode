          <h1 class="page-title"> Major Website Update 2/28/2019</h1>
            <p> Hi Folks,</p>
            <p> If you have ever glanced at this website before today, you will notice I made some pretty big changes. I'm not going to list them all out because that would be boring and a waste of space. Basically I just updated the cholor scheme, added more things to the home page, added my resume, and fixed some readibility issues.</p>
            <p> I mentioned that I might add a video in the 2/4/2019 (1) post, and I still hope to do that I just don't have the time- this update was more important. If you are dying to see it, though, feel free to click the Facebook link on the home page and check it out (Facebook saw it first).</p>
            <p> Currently I'm working on a web project that needs to be auto updated once a month. I'm using Xampp, Derby, Spring, Excel, Visual Basic, and batch files to make it happen, and I would argue that I'm making decent progress. I'm not going to give any more information than that, but I will let you all know when I finish it (even though I can't show it off).</p>
            <p> There may not be another post for a while since I am going to be busy at work this week and the next (sorry to my 0 followers).</p>
            <p> NOTE: Yes I know about the bug where the tabs in the top right move around like crazy when resizing the window- I now know why this is happening and am looking for an easy fix.

            <p> Enjoy the weekend everyone, </p>
