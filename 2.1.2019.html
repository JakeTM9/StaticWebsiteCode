            <p>This is my first official post on this website. I'm not sure exactly what I want to do with this site yet. I've been thinking about using it as sort of a blog which sounds dumb but running my own blog website is probably good practice. Also I think I'm going to leave up the services tab as if someone wants me to build them a website of this quality for them I can do it. In the near future I hope to set up an easier way to navigate posts so look forward to that friends. </p>
