          <p> Hi Folks,</p>
          <p>So about that move...............................</p>
          <p>Yeah it didn't happen. I ran up a bill with AWS and HostGator trying to figure it out but nothing seemed to work out the way I wanted. I think I'm going to chill here on GitHub pages a bit longer and then just grab hosting from like GoDaddy in the near future (I'll just surprise you all).</p>
          <p>Remember when I made that projects link on the home page of this site and then just made it link back to the main page of the site? Well it actually links to a Projects page now and I even have one "completed" project - BLACKJACK. It's pretty lame but I'm just glad I got it working the way I wanted it to. You can expect big things from the projects tab in the near future. </p>
          <p>So here is a list of things that I'm going to be working on:</p>
          <p>1. New Project</p>
          <p>2. A real domain and hosting</p>
          <p>3. A real way to catalog these text posts</p>
          <p>4. New colors- this theme makes me sleepy</p>

          <p>Might be another couple weeks before I push another post, but know that I'm #workinhard.</p>


          <p> Peace out, </p>
