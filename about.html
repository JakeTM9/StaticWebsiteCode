              Well geez you kinda put me on the spot here. IDK if I'd say this is about "US" as I, Jakob Wardega, made this site all on my own (with the help of Traversity Media's instructional youtube video def go check it out if u think this is neat). I knew from a very young age that I would grow up to become internet famous I just didnt realize it would happen so quickly. I'm a big fan of mint chocolate chip ice cream so thats like one cool fact. UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH yeah that about sums it up thanks for reading.

              Oh shoot I forgot I made a second paragraph here. I just wanted to see if I could make a dark one in contrast to the light one. Hey I haven't mentioned my Newsletter yet so definitly subscribe to it because I put out a lot of really cool stuff daily. Yesterday I totally stole a meme off twitter and forwarded it to like a handful of people. You definitly want to be on the mailing list.
