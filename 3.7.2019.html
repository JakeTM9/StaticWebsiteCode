            <p> Hi Folks,</p>
            <p> So I might be leaving this github page soon, but do not despair because I am moving this site to a shared server. I bought some space from host gator so you already know what that means- databases and javascript. It is about to get crazy.</p>
            <p> Ideally this will be the final post on this site before the move. Wow I'm getting emotional- I've learned so much on this stupid github page. The last thing I'm going to do once the new site goes live is make a link on this page to the new site, so I guess it will still be connected. Maybe I'll add a secret link from the new site to this one. I'd definitely call this site the "Legacy Site" because, let's be real, that sounds badass. </p>
            <p> Well I guess there is no need for another post since when the site goes up I'm just going to add a link to the new site, so I guess this is goodbye.</p>


            <p> See you in the next site, </p>
